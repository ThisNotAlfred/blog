# Hi I'm Mohammad Ali Talebi. ðŸ¦«

A gazing programmer looking to catch new opportunities over the horizon. ðŸ™‚

This small blog is my small endeavor at teaching myself and potentially other people about new things I see over the Internet everyday.

you can find me at my [github](https://github.com/thisnotalfred) and on my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammadalitalebi/).

I hope you enjoy your stay.
