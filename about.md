# Hi I'm Mohammad Ali Talebi. 

A gazing programmer looking at new opportunities over the horizon to catch. ðŸ™‚

This small blog is my small endeavor at teaching myself and potentially other people about new things I see over the Internet everyday.

## Where can I find you?

You can find me at my [Github](https://github.com/ThisNotAlfred/) or at my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammadalitalebi)

Thanks for reading!
